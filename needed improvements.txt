things i'd like to add and know im capable of adding but just lost motivation and time to do so:

1. high score board at gameover screen
	use local storage (maybe even database stuff for non-local high scores but that'd take some work)

2. enemy spaceships etc
	shoot at player (find players position, rotate appropriately, shoot laser with same angle etc)
	BOSSES

3. change power-up system, have random planets to go to and shop for different weapons using space-cred which is just score
	would be cool but would take a lot of work

4. wanted to incorporate cat sounds when player is hurt and dies, but couldnt find any good ones (didnt spend that much time looking)

5. adding camera to follow player 
	instead of bouncing from one side of screen to the other when player leaves boundary
	would allow adding tons of new stuff like planets etc, not enough room to add stuff right now
